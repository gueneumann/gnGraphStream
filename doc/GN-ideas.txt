Representations of Graphs

Use graphstream

Ideas for dynamic graphs:

when processing a stream of text, extract terms or relations and dynamically compute
support of node n at time t
occurrence of n in document set D_t at time t
|D_t(n)|
confidence of a pair of nodes (n_i, n_j) at  time t
| D_t(n_i) geschnitten D_t(n_j)| / |D_t(n_i)|
so seen, n_i defines the confidence for n_j (refers to/ defines context)

Dynamic graphs:
layout of a graph G_t depends on layout of graph at t-1 G_(t-1)
It also takes into account the information about the support of concepts:
 the greater the support, the bigger the corresponding node. 
The “age” of concepts (number of periods where these concepts consecutively appear) is quite important as well: 
new nodes are marked with yellow
and when they become older they gradually turn into blue. 
Moreover, if a concept appears for the first time (not after a break), 
the corresponding node receives a wide black border.

Using Nemex Text Streams:
support and confidence can be computed on basis of term frequency
thus, if we define a time interval t (e.g., N recent chunks)
we can draw dynamically a graph and visualize the change of nodes
size of nodes
age of nodes
growth of graph
we only show „young and large enough“ node


GNSSMM approach:
can I also use distance
